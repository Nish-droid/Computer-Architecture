CMSC 411

In this course, we will study topics in computer systems architecture. 
We will first discuss the contents in Appendix A through C of the text (pipelining, instruction set principles, and memory hierarchy). 
Then, we will switch to other topics such as superscalar execution, branch prediction, dynamic scheduling, hardware multithreading, shared memory architecture, and GPU.
